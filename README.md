## About

Mastering the ```Data Flow``` is essential when building your SwiftUI apps. Use this project to learn how to use SwiftUI's State, Binding, and the Observable Object protocol. In conclusion, take a look at how passing the data in the Environment works.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/developer-academy-unina/Lab-Data-Flow
   ```

2. Open the ```.xcodeproj``` file

### How to

1. Open the Starter project

2. Create the ```NewLearnerView``` like shown in the picture above

3. Implement the modal navigation to add a new learner by using the ```State``` and ```Binding``` mechanism from ```LearnerListView``` to ```NewLearnerView```

4. Pass the function to add new learners in ```NewLearnerView``` as a parameter

4. Add the function to add a new learner and delete them in the ```LearnerViewModel```

5. Mark the LearnerViewModel as with the ```@Observable``` macro to refresh the interface whenever changes in the data occur

6. Experiment with the ```Environment``` by creating the instance of ```LearnerViewModel``` in the ```LearnersApp.swift``` file (the app entry point), feeding it to the Environment of the ```TabView``` (by using the ```.environment(:_)``` modifier), and retrieving it from the Environment in the Views that need the data (don't forget to provide the Views' Previews with the environment instance, otherwise the previews will crash)

7. Connect the functions to the buttons' actions

6. Launch the app on the simulator and check if your version is similar to the Final project
